\section{Introduction}
Secure Communication has always been an important 
\section{Theory}
In conventional cryptography, the information is shared using public keys for encryption
and private keys for decryption. However, the security of these methods 
relies on the computational difficulty of a computer. For example, RSA method
utilises the fact that it is much harder to factorise a 
number into its prime factors than to multiply two prime numbers together. However,
with the advent of quantum computers, we have algorithms like Shor's algorithm
which can efficiently factorise large numbers, thus breaking the security of RSA.
So there is a need for cryptographic methods that are secure against such
attacks. This is where Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) comes into play.  Instead of 
relying on computational difficulty, QKD used the principles of quantum
mechanics to ensure that the key distribution is secure. In this experiment we will 
discuss the BB84 protocol, which is one of the first and most well-known QKD
protocols. 
\subsection{BB84 Quantum Key Distribution Protocol}
BB84 protocol was proposed by Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard in 1984. It utilises
the properties of quantum mechanics to securely distribute a cryptographic key.
Once we share a secret key, we can use it to encrypt and decrypt messages which can now 
be transmitted using a classical channel. In order to share a key using BB84   
protocol, we will take two communicating people, conventionally called Alice 
and Bob, who want to share a secret key. In order to share the key with BB84 protocal 
they need to follow the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Preparation and Transmission:} Alice randomly selects a sequence of bits
Here randomness is crucial for the success of the protocol. She also randomly chooses
a basis (rectilinear or diagonal) for each bit. She will then encode each randomly chosen bit in the 
polarisation state of the photon according to the randomly chosen basis and sends the photons to BOB.
    \item \textbf{Bob's Measurement:} Upon receiving the photons, Bob randomly chooses a basis (rectilinear or diagonal) 
    for measuring each incoming photon. He records the measurement results and store them in the
    form of bits. Note that the bit encoding scheme for polarisation states is 
    the same as Alice's encoding scheme. However, since Bob is choosing his measurement
    basis randomly, there will be instances where his chosen basis does not match
    Alice's encoding basis. Thus to make sense of the bits, they
    will need to communicate over a classical channel.
    \item \textbf{Classical communication}: Now Alice and Bob communicate over
    a classical channel. Bob tells Alice which basis he used for each measurement,
    but he will not reveal the measurement results. Alice then reveals to Bob
    which measurements were done in the correct basis. They will discard all thebibliography
    bits where the measurement basis did not match. The remaining bits constitute
    the potential secret key.
    \item \textbf{Error Rate Estimation and eavesdropper detection:} The purpose of the 
    BB84 protocol is to securely share a key. To do this, Alice and Bob
    should be able to detect the presence of an eavesdropper (conventionally called Eve).
    Eve on the other hand wants to intercept the quantum states sent by Alice
    and measure them to gain information about the key. However, BB84 protocol utilises
    two important features of quantum mechanics to detect Eve's presence:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{No-Cloning Theorem:} It is impossible for Eve to have a complete knowledge of the
        quantum state being transmitted with a single measurement. In order to do so she has to
         make a copy machine that creates an identical copy of an arbitrary unknown quantum state.
         But according to no cloning theorem it is not possible to do so. Thus, Eve cannot simply copy
        the quantum states sent by Alice, measure them and send a copy to Bob.
        \item \textbf{Measurement Disturbance:} When Eve measures the quantum states, she will
        project them into one of the basis states. If her chosen measurement basis does not match Alice's encoding basis,
        she will introduce errors in the measurement results. When Bob measures the states sent by Eve, 
        he will get incorrect results for those bits where Eve's measurement basis did not match Alice's encoding basis.
        This will be the case as alice choses a random basis for encoding and this is one of the reasons why randomness is so crucial
        in the BB84 protocol.
      \end{itemize}
      

Bob and Alice are able to detect Eve's presence because of these two features. To estimate the error rate,
they will randomly select a subset of the remaining bits (the ones where Bob's measurement basis matched Alice's encoding basis)
and compare them over the classical channel. If the error rate is above a certain threshold, they will conclude that Eve is present and abort the key generation process.
If the error rate is below the threshold, they can conclude that the channel is secure and can use the remaining bits as 
the secret key. Note that we use a threshold because in practical scenarios, there can be 
errors due to noise in the channel, detector inefficiencies etc. 

\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Security of Classical Channel}
      It is necessary for Alice and Bob to communicate over a classical channel to
      determine the basis matching is secure. This means that even Bob needs to ensure that he is 
      communicating with Alice and not Eve. This can be done using authentication methods
      like pre-shared keys or digital signatures. 

\section{Experimental Realization}
\begin{figure}[h!]

    \includegraphics[]{setup.png}
    \caption{Schematic of the experimental setup for BB84 protocol implementation. Source:\cite{}}
    \label{fig:bb84_setup}
\end{figure}
The experimental setup for the implementation of BB84 protocol is shown in figure \ref{fig:bb84_setup}.
However, in this experiment we will not be using HWP to prepare the states as shown in the figure,
but a Polariser as our photon source is also producing circularly polarised light. This setup is an educational setup which uses quCR 
as a central interface for interacting with various components. The Polarisers are connected to qu3MD which
controls their orientation through a motor. The single photon detectors are in the quCR
which is connected to the polariser by an optical fibre. We use BBO crystal to generate a photon
pair through Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC). One photon of the pair is discarded while
the other is used for the BB84 protocol. The Pump laser is a 405 nm laser diode. This is 
operated in pulse wave mode to generate weak coherant pulses.

\subsection{Weak coherant Pulses}
In practical implementations of BB84 protocol, it is difficult to generate
single photons. They are still an active area of research.  So in this experiment
we will be using weak coherant pulses. Since attenuating a laser pulse does not change
its statistical properties,  the probability of having k photon in a pulse is as follows:
\begin{equation}
    P(k,\lambda) = \frac{\lambda^k}{k!}e^{-\lambda}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the average photon number per pulse.  Now for BB84 protocol to be secure,
we want to minimise the probability of having more than one photon in a pulse as this can be exploited
by Eve to
